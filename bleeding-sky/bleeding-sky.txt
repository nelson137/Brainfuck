The Day The Sky Bleed

On the day the sky turned red,
She brought them back to roam the Earth: all of the undead.
The people screamed in fear; to their homes each one of them fled.
Alone to wander as I pleased, my legs I then could spread.

To the cemetery I did tread;
Ominous was the gatekeeper, standing there ahead.
The trees were almost dead.
Their limbs hung limp--they were clearly underfed.

Ever confident did she look, standing by the shed.
We talked and laughed but why she did it was never said.
Hours passed before they returned, my heart then filled with dread.
I wished to stay forever, to my home I returned instead.

Rain pounded on my roof; for this somber day the clouds were bled.
In silence I watched the fire die, my thoughts were left unsaid.
Now the sun has finally set, I shall climb into my deathbed;
On the day the sky turned red.
